Attempt to make a decent-looking CV with biblatex. Perpetually under construction..

The idea here was to make a LaTeX CV for which I woudln't have to type/copy in bibliographic info by hand. 
Used and modified R Hyndman's CV style (see .sty file for link).
I grabbed my pubs in BibTeX file from ADS, and the thing sort of works, but there are some 
minor details still to work out wih biblatex to get the references in the usual astronomy style.
