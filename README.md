Attempt to make a decent-looking CV with biblatex. Perpetually under construction..

The idea here was to make a LaTeX CV for which I woudln't have to type/copy in bibliographic info by hand. 
Used and modified R Hyndman's CV style (see .sty file for link).
I grabbed my pubs in BibTeX file from ADS, and the thing sort of works, but there are some things I still
have to work out:
- get the author listing to more closely match the std astro style
- bold my own name in author list
- have AAS meeting abstracts listed in a less wordy way
- need to enter the many conference abstracts not on ADS (esp CASCA)
